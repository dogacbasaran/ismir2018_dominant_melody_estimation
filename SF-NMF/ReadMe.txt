This folder contains the Source-Filter NMF training codes. The original codes are written by Jean-Louis Durrieu, here they are slightly modified to observe the HF0 salience performance through each update. 

The default parameters can be found in the "parsing.py" file that contains the options for the parametres.

Example usage examples are given in the "extract_HF0.py" file.
