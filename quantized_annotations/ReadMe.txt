This folder contains the quantized annotations for the MedleyDB dataset. In the MedleyDB set, the annotations in continuous frequency in Hz, they are quantized into semitone frequencies and then into class labels. Note that in this work, the output is semitone resolution with 61 possible notes (from A1 to A6), there is also one class for non-melody frames.

The notes and their corresponding class tags are as follows:

non-melody -1
A1          0
A1#         1
B1          2
C2          3
